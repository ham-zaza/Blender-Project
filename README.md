This is my first 3D modeling project created using Blender. The model showcases a low-poly water well, built using basic modeling techniques such as extrusion, loop cuts, snapping, and object duplication.

ðŸ›  Key Features:
-> Stylized low-poly design
-> Handcrafted bricks, wooden beams, and rooftop tiles
-> Simple lighting and shadows for presentation
-> Made entirely using Blenderâ€™s basic tools (no advanced modifiers or sculpting)

ðŸŽ¯ Goal:
The goal of this project was to get hands-on experience with the Blender UI and core modeling concepts while building something visually coherent and game-ready.
